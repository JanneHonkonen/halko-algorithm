# Ethical Considerations  
## Risks  
1. **Computational Costs**: HAâ€™s 3D tensors may increase energy usage.  
2. **Bias Propagation**: Dynamic routing could amplify dataset biases.  

## Mitigations  
- Partner with green AI initiatives for efficient training.  
- Implement differential fairness testing [^1].  

[^1]: Align with OECD AI Principles (2019).
